## Introduction

AzerothCore is an open source game-server application for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 3.3.5a game version.

It is written in C++ and based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.

This is the Alasiya Branch, which is based on older code to build/run on my servers.
Updates are hand-picked from upstream for compatibility with my servers.
Very Minor changes and additions based on my personal preference for my server and site.



## Why AzerothCore?

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience. In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**.

We also believe in [software modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), because the more the software is modular, and the more it will be easy to be maintained, understood, developed, etc... So we organized the structure of AzerothCore as modular as possible, giving the possibility to [create new modules](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/Create-a-Module) to add custom features (instead of patching the core).

## Learning project

AzerothCore is a learning project.
If you want to learn how to use C++, SQL, git, etc... you came to the right place! We will gladly help you: **programming is our passion**.

If you want to contribute, in [our wiki](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki) you fill find a lot of resources that will guide you. Also you can poke us in [our discord chat server](https://discord.gg/gkt4y2x).
